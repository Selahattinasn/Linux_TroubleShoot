In Rocky Linux, you can retrieve configuration files for various services and settings based on the service you are working with. The configuration files are typically stored in the /etc directory. Below are some common ways to get or locate configuration files for different services or the system itself:
1. System Configuration Files

The system-wide configuration files are usually found in /etc. Some commonly used configuration files include:

 +   /etc/hostname: Contains the system's hostname.
 +   /etc/hosts: Maps IP addresses to hostnames.
 +   /etc/resolv.conf: Contains DNS settings.
 +   /etc/fstab: File system mount points.

You can view the contents of these files with cat or less commands:

'''
cat /etc/hostname
'''
2. Service Configuration Files

Each service in Rocky Linux typically has its own directory inside /etc. For example:

    Apache (httpd):
    The Apache web server configuration is located in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf. To view the configuration:

    bash

cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

NGINX:
For NGINX, the configuration is in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:

bash

cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

SSH:
The SSH server's configuration is located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

bash

cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

MySQL or MariaDB:
The MySQL/MariaDB configuration file is commonly found at /etc/my.cnf or /etc/mysql/my.cnf:

bash

    cat /etc/my.cnf

3. Networking Configuration

To get the network configuration details, use files like:

    /etc/sysconfig/network: General network configuration.
    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>: Contains configuration for network interfaces.

Example:

bash

cat /etc/sysconfig/network
cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

4. Firewall Configuration (firewalld)

Firewalld configuration files are usually stored in /etc/firewalld/. The default zone configuration is typically located at:

bash

cat /etc/firewalld/zones/public.xml

5. Grabbing the Entire Configuration Folder for Backup

You can copy the entire /etc folder to save the system configuration:

bash

sudo cp -r /etc /backup/location/

6. Using Commands to Retrieve Service Configuration Paths

You can also use system utilities like systemctl or ss to manage services and find their configuration files.

For example, to list the configuration path for a service:

bash

systemctl show -p FragmentPath <service_name>

Example for Apache:

bash

systemctl show -p FragmentPath httpd

7. Package Default Configurations

For some applications, you might want to know the default configuration shipped by the package. You can use rpm to query the configuration files installed by the package:

bash

rpm -qc <package_name>

Example for httpd:

bash

rpm -qc httpd

8. Custom Configuration Files

Sometimes applications or administrators place custom configuration files outside of /etc. Check the service's documentation or the /usr/local directory for any such files.

Let me know which service you are specifically working with if you need a more detailed explanation!
